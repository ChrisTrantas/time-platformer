## How to Use the Tile Placement Toolbox

### What the Tile Placement Toolbox Is

* A way to quickly place prefabs into a scene and align them to a grid

* A way to rapidly prototype out new level designs

### What the Tile Placement Toolbox Is Not

* A way to move around pre-existing objects and snap them to a grid

* The only way that makes sense to create more levels

### Usage

In order to use the Tile Placement Toolbox you must have the GridManager prefab
in the scene. After that you will need to open up the toolbox by going to
Window -> "Tile Placement Toolbox". Once the toolbox is open you will click on
the button that represents the type of tile you want to place, then click back
into the scene and press the 'A' key to place that tile. To stop this keybind
simply close the Tile Placement Toolbox until you need it again.
